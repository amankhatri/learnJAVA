 * 2) Threads in deleting

		/*The problem occurs when we start to think about how to terminate a thread properly in the cases like the one given below with while loop
		 * We can do that by using Thread Interruptions but here we will do this by shared data. To do this we will use a boolean variable. And  
		 * change the variable running from true to false, we can also interrupt the main method and  in between by using scanner. THis way
		 * always works but there is a catch
		 * Some processors may cache the value of running as true which may result in never ending loop. 
		 * More explanation: So method run is in its separate thread and main always runs in its own little separate thread. However
		 * we call the method processor1.shutDown which ends up interfering with running variable which is used by different thread. 
		 * Being two different threads some processor may now let them interfere with each other. This can be resolved by re-naming the 
		 * class Processor extends Thread to class volatile Processor extends Thread. This makes it guranteed to work on all processors.*/
