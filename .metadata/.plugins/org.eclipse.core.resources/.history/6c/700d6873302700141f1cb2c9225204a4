		//now to set variables we would have to create an object for the class frog
		// and we would have to know the names of the variables in the class like this:
		Frog frog1 = new Frog();
		frog1.name = "Frog1";
		frog1.age = 10;
		System.out.println("Frog1.name: "+frog1.name);
		System.out.println("Frog1.age: "+frog1.age);
		//however knowing the names of the variables is not nessacary because we can use 
		//methods to set the variables of a class, these methods are called setters for example
		// see the two setters in class frog.
