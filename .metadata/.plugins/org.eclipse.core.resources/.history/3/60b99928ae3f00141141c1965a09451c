/*Serialization means if we take an object and serialize it, 
 * we turn it into a binary form/data, if we 
 * deserialize data that would mean we change the data back from
 * binary to object. Here we would be looking 
 * at serializing the files which is what people 
 * usually mean. In this project we will serialize
 * a file. So we will take objects of the person class
 * and write it into a file and then we will see how to 
 * read them from the file and turn into objects.*/
