 * deserialize data that would mean we change the data back from

 * usually mean. In this project we will serialize
 * a file. So we will take objects of the person class
 * and write it into a file and then we will see how to

	 * something to try to understand this: 
	 * 1) run the Write Objects
	 * 2) change serialVersionUID = 4801633306273802062L to 3801633306273802062L;
	 * 3) run the ReadObjects.java . 
	 * an error pops up, so we can conclude that this serialidversion
	 * relates the reading object to writing objects and is unique the
	 * class you should read with should match the class you wrote with
	 * You should not serialize everything in the program like you should
	 * never serialize threads . you can prevent serializing by using 
	 * transient keyword like this: 	private transient int id;
